# Geometry and related ideas
Nothing too advanced, just whatever shows up

## Lines
**Intersection of lines**\
$ax+b=cx+d$\
$\Rightarrow x=\dfrac{d-b}{a-c}$

## Trig
**Definitions**\
$a, b, c$ are the 3 side lengths\
$A, B, C$ are the interior angles opposite to their corresponding (lowercase) sides

**Law of cosines**\
Useful for finding angles from arbitary points on the plane, etc\
$c^2=a^2+b^2-2ab*cos(C)$\
$\Rightarrow C=acos(\dfrac{c^2-a^2-b^2}{-2ab})$
