## Priorities
1. Simple and easy to understand code short enough to be typed out during contests.
2. Good performance. It's nice to have most of your optimization work done in advance!
3. Convenient interfaces. What this looks like is kinda formed from trial and error through implementing a lot of solutions.

## Why
KACTL is very concise, but often slow, and I really dislike their interfaces. Atcoder Library is very fast and has nice interfaces, but is intended to be included as a black-box and infeasible to type out.

Is this library better? Probably not.

## Notes
* Inclusive intervals and 0-indexing for all interfaces.
* Templates use features up to C++17, debug header uses C++20. GCC builtins are occasionally used.
* There's a bit of basic template code as defined in [template.cpp](local/template.cpp), but it's very minimal.
